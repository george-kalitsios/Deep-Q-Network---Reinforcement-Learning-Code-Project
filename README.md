### CartPole-v0
We're going to be building and training a deep Q-network to learn to balance a pole on a moving cart.
The cart and pole problem consists of a cart that can move left and right along a frictionless track. The cart has a pole attached to the top of it, which starts out in a vertical upright position, however, by design, the pole will fall either to the left or right when not balanced. The goal here is to prevent this pole from falling over. A reward of +1 will be given for each time step that the pole remains upright, and an episode will deemed over when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical or when the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center of the screen.

So, essentially, the longer the pole remains upright without deviating too far from the center of the screen, the more reward our agent will get.
